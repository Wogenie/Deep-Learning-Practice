**Medical Image Diagnostic System (Pneumonia Detection)**:

 A binary classification project that uses a CNN to identify **pneumonia** from **chest X-ray images**.


Key Components: Implementation of data augmentation (rotation, zooming, flipping), dropout layers for regularization, and the use of Binary Cross-Entropy loss.

2) **Multi-Class Image Classification (CIFAR-10 & CIFAR-100)**:


Training models to recognize objects across 10 and 100 different categories.


KTesting model scalability and accuracy improvements using deeper CNN architectures.

2. **Projects_before_CNN.ipynb**
This file focuses on the foundational mathematics and logic of neural networks before moving into specialized computer vision architectures.

**Training a Single Neuron**:


Description: A fundamental project demonstrating the basic mechanics of a single perceptron.


Key Components: Visualizing weight updates and understanding how a single unit learns from data.

Forward and Backpropagation Mechanics:


Description: An educational implementation showing how data flows forward through a network and how errors are sent back to update weights.

**Face Emotion Classification (using standard NN)**:


Description: A project that attempts to classify human emotions from facial images using a basic Dense Neural Network (Artificial Neural Network) instead of a CNN.
