1. Everything_in_NN.ipynb
This file contains advanced implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) focused on medical diagnostics and complex dataset classification.

Medical Image Diagnostic System (Pneumonia Detection):


Description: A binary classification project that uses a CNN to identify pneumonia from chest X-ray images.


Key Components: Implementation of data augmentation (rotation, zooming, flipping), dropout layers for regularization, and the use of Binary Cross-Entropy loss.

Multi-Class Image Classification (CIFAR-10 & CIFAR-100):


Description: Training models to recognize objects across 10 and 100 different categories.


Key Components: Testing model scalability and accuracy improvements using deeper CNN architectures.

Tiny ImageNet Challenge:


Description: A high-level project aimed at classifying images across more than 300 classes to test the limits of the network architecture.

2. Projects_before_CNN.ipynb
This file focuses on the foundational mathematics and logic of neural networks before moving into specialized computer vision architectures.

Training a Single Neuron:


Description: A fundamental project demonstrating the basic mechanics of a single perceptron.


Key Components: Visualizing weight updates and understanding how a single unit learns from data.

Forward and Backpropagation Mechanics:


Description: An educational implementation showing how data flows forward through a network and how errors are sent back to update weights.

Face Emotion Classification (using standard NN):


Description: A project that attempts to classify human emotions from facial images using a basic Dense Neural Network (Artificial Neural Network) instead of a CNN.
